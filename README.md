# Geometry Calculator

## Overview
This Java program calculates the distance between two points in a two-dimensional plane based on user-provided coordinates. It utilizes a simple console interface to prompt the user for input and validates the entered values before performing the calculation.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the coordinates for the first point $\(x_1,\\ y_1)$ when prompted.
3. Enter the coordinates for the second point $\(x_2,\\ y_2)$ when prompted.
4. The program will validate the input, ensuring they are numerical values.
5. The result will be displayed on the console.

## Formula Used
The distance between two points is calculated using the following formula:
$\ \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \$

## Input Validation
The program uses exception handling to validate user input. If the user provides an invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values or missing values), the program will prompt the user to enter the coordinates again.

## Example Usage
```
Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 2.5
Enter x2 and y2: 4.5 7.5
The Distance between the two points is 5.83095
```

## Notes
- Ensure that you enter valid numeric values for coordinates to obtain accurate results.
- The program utilizes exception handling to handle invalid input gracefully.
- You can modify and adapt the code for educational or personal use.
